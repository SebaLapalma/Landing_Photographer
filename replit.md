## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: Uses a single HTML template with JavaScript for smooth scrolling and interactions
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Bootstrap 5 for mobile-first responsive layout
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript, enhanced with animations and interactions

### Backend Architecture
- **Flask Framework**: Lightweight Python web framework serving the application
- **Template Engine**: Jinja2 templating for dynamic content rendering
- **Static File Serving**: Flask's built-in static file serving for CSS, JavaScript, and assets

### Styling and UI
- **CSS Framework**: Bootstrap 5 for responsive grid system and components
- **Custom CSS**: Additional styling with CSS custom properties for theming
- **Typography**: Google Fonts (Playfair Display for headings, Inter for body text)
- **Icons**: Font Awesome for scalable vector icons

## Key Components

### Application Structure
- **app.py**: Main Flask application with route definitions
- **main.py**: Application entry point for deployment
- **templates/index.html**: Single page template with complete UI structure
- **static/css/styles.css**: Custom styling and theme variables

## Data Flow

1. **Request Handling**: Flask receives HTTP requests and routes them to appropriate handlers
2. **Template Rendering**: Jinja2 processes the HTML template with any dynamic data
3. **Static Asset Delivery**: CSS, JavaScript, and image files served directly by Flask
4. **Client-Side Enhancement**: JavaScript adds interactive features and animations
5. **External Communication**: WhatsApp integration for direct client contact

## External Dependencies

### Backend Dependencies

- **Font Awesome**: Icon library via CDN
- **Google Fonts**: Typography (Playfair Display, Inter)

### Third-Party Integrations
- **WhatsApp Business API**: Direct messaging functionality
- **Intersection Observer API**: Scroll-based animations

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Local Development**: Flask development server with debug mode
- **Hot Reload**: Debug mode enables automatic reloading on code changes
- **Environment Variables**: Session secret key configurable via environment

### Production Considerations
- **WSGI Server**: Application designed to work with production WSGI servers
- **Static File Optimization**: CDN usage for external dependencies
- **Security**: Session secret key should be set via environment variables

### Configuration
- **Host**: Configured to bind to all interfaces (0.0.0.0)
- **Port**: Default port 5000 for development
- **Debug Mode**: Enabled for development, should be disabled in production

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Technology Stack Choice
- **Problem**: Need for a lightweight, fast-loading portfolio website
- **Solution**: Flask with minimal dependencies for backend, Bootstrap for frontend
- **Rationale**: Reduces complexity while maintaining professional appearance and functionality

### Single Page Design
- **Problem**: Portfolio websites need to showcase work efficiently
- **Solution**: Single-page application with smooth scrolling navigation
- **Pros**: Fast loading, smooth user experience, easy maintenance
- **Cons**: Limited SEO optimization, all content loads at once

### WhatsApp Integration
- **Problem**: Need for direct client communication
- **Solution**: WhatsApp Web API integration for instant messaging
- **Rationale**: Popular messaging platform with high engagement rates

### CDN Dependencies
- **Problem**: External library management and loading speed
- **Solution**: Use CDN links for Bootstrap, Font Awesome, and Google Fonts
- **Pros**: Faster loading, reduced server load, automatic updates
- **Cons**: Dependency on external services, potential privacy concerns
